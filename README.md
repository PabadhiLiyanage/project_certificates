# Certificate Generation Project
## Introduction
This Ballerina project automates the generation of certificates by utilizing a PDF template. It interacts with a Google Sheet to retrieve names for inclusion in the certificates. The generated PDFs can be stored locally within the project directory and uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket, with the option to retrieve the URL for each uploaded certificate. Additionally, applicant details can be stored in a new Google Sheet for record-keeping and tracking purposes.
